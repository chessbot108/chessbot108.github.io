### Problem

You have $N$ intervals $[l_1, r_1] \dots [l_n, r_n]$ which denote the set of integers in that range. There are three type of operations between intervals.
1. Union (or)
2. Intersection (and)
3. Symmetric Difference (xor)

Over all $3^{n-1}$ ways to apply each operation on the intervals in order, find expected size of the final set $\times 3^{n-1}$ . Since this number is large, please find it mod $998244353$.

$2 \leq N \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, 0 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$

Sample (since the one in the problem is bad)

```
2
1 1
2 2
```

the answer is 4. $[1, 1] \cup [2, 2] = 2$, $[1, 1] \oplus [2, 2] = 2$, and $[1, 1] \cap [2, 2] = 0$ the total sum is 4

### thoughts

the original problem did not originally use EV in the definition. I just thought it was easier to explain this way. Thinking abt it as EV encourages considering each element's contribution to the answer seperately due to the linearity of expectation.

now how would we solve it for just one value?


### solution

so first we can consider a sweep. for a fixed x, lets definte an array size $n$ $t$ where $t_i = 1$ iff $l_i \leq x \leq r_i$. Then we just have to consider what would happen to the probabilty its a $1$ at the end as it gets operated on each $t_i$ in succession. This somewhat motivations matrix multiplication to describe the probabilities. There is one matrix when $t_i = 1$ and another when $t_i = 0$. The final probabilty can be retrieved with a product of all the matrices.

one can bash out the 2 2x2 matrices (8 cases) by considering the probability that $a$ operated with $b$ will result in $c$. 


Finally, one can notice that the array $t$ for $x$ and the array $t$ for $x +1$ are very similar. This motivates a way to update our matrix product. The final solution revolves around a segtree that stores the product of 2x2 matrices. As the wise words of a wise person say, "Segtree is the static form of dnq" and that is very well present here.


```cpp
struct matrix{
	array<array<ll, 2>, 2> mat;
	matrix(){
		for(auto& y : mat){
			for(auto& x : y) x = 0ll;
		}
	}
	matrix(int e){
		for(auto& y : mat){
			for(auto& x : y) x = 0ll;
		}
		if(e == 0){
			mat[0][0] = 1;
			mat[1][1] = 1;
		}else if(e == 1){
			mat[0][0] = 1;
			mat[1][0] = third;
			mat[0][1] = 0;
			mat[1][1] = third*2;
		}else{
			mat[0][0] = third;
			mat[1][0] = third;
			mat[0][1] = 2*third;
			mat[1][1] = 2*third;
		}
	}
	matrix operator * (matrix b){
		matrix c = matrix();
		for(int i = 0; i<2; i++){
			for(int j = 0; j<2; j++){
				for(int k = 0; k<2; k++){
					c.mat[i][k] += mat[i][j] * b.mat[j][k];
					c.mat[i][k] %= mod;
				}
			}
		}
		return c;
	}
};

....

	n = in;
	for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
		auto tmp = matrix(1);
		U(i, tmp, 0, 0, s);
	}
	int rell, relr;
	for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
		int l = in, r = in;
		if(i != 0){
			adj[l].pb(mp(i, 2));
			adj[r+1].pb(mp(i, 1));
		}else{
			rell = l;
			relr = r;
		}
	}
	for(int i = 0; i<=3e5; i++){
		for(auto [p, u] : adj[i]){
			auto tmp = matrix(u);
			U(p, tmp, 0, 0, s);
		}
		matrix tmp = S(1, n, 0, 0, s);
		int state = (rell <= i && i <= relr);
		contr[i] = tmp.mat[state][1];
	}	
	ll ans = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i<=3e5; i++){
		ans += contr[i];
		ans %= mod;
	}
	for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
		ans *= 3;
		ans %= mod;
	}
	cout << ans << "\n";
