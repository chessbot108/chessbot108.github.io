### Edu round 132

Good contest as a whole. I spent too long on A and B. I dont quite know why my code for B works, I'm still convinced that my code is negative when its supposed to be positive.

```cpp

    ll pre[MX], pre2[MX];
    int arr[MX];
     
    void solve(){
        int n = in, m = in;
        for(int i = 1; i<=n; i++){
            arr[i] = in;
            pre[i] = pre[i-1] + max(0, arr[i-1] - arr[i]);
        }        
        for(int i = n; i>=1; i--){
            pre2[i] = pre2[i+1] + max(0, arr[i+1] - arr[i]);
            cerr << pre2[i] << " ";
        } cerr << "\n";
        for(int i = 1; i<=m; i++){
            int a = in, b = in;
            if(a <= b){
	            cout << pre[b] - pre[a]  << "\n";
            }else{
                cout << pre2[b] - pre2[a] << "\n";
            }
        }
    }

```

I'm personally convinced that its supposed to be `pre2[a] - pre2[b]`. 

As for C, I had a weird greedy. So say there are $a$ $($'s and $b$ $)$'s that you have to insert. I inserted all of the $($'s before the $)$'s, and I assume that always made a working bracket sequence. So if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, then there is only one unique solution. Otherwise I swapped the last $($ that I inserted and my first $)$ that I inserted and checked if the new one was a valid bracket sequence as well. I assumed that if any second bracket sequence existed, my way would also find it. Proof by ac I guess.

```cpp

int check(string s){
	int pre = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i<sz(s); i++){
		pre += s[i] == '(' ? 1 : -1;
		if(pre < 0) return 0;
	}
	return pre == 0;
}

void solve(){
	string s = in;
	int n = sz(s)/2;
	int pre = 0;
	int c1 = 0, c2 = 0;
	for(char c : s){
		c1 += c == '(';
		c2 += c == ')';
	}
	vector<int> rel;
	for(int i = 0; i<sz(s); i++){
		if(s[i] == '?') rel.pb(i);
	}
	assert(sz(rel) == (n - c1) + (n - c2));
	for(int i = 0; i<(n - c1); i++){
		s[rel[i]] = '(';
	}
	for(int i = (n - c1); i<(n - c1) + (n - c2); i++){
		s[rel[i]] = ')';
	}
	assert(check(s));
	kill(n - c1 == 0 || n - c2 == 0, "YES");
	swap(s[rel[n - c1 - 1]], s[rel[n - c1]]);
	if(check(s)) cout << "NO\n";
	else cout << "YES\n";
}
```


I had two penalties on D for being stupid, otherwise its a pretty easy problem.
