### Problem

[problem link](https://codeforces.com/gym/102341/problem/C)

This problem is interactive. You are given a grid thats size $n$ by $n$ with all distinct values. For all cells $(x, y)$ that are not the maximum in the grid, one of the adjacent cells or a cell connected by the corner will be strictly larger than it. Find the cell of the maximum value in $3 \cdot n + 210$ queries.

$(1 \leq n \leq 2000)$


### thoughts
i received a hint that it is related to a dnq problem on grid we did two days before. 

### solution in $6 \cdot n$ queries
So you start off with the premise that its a dnq. Say you are splitting the grid in half. You can query the all the values along the side of that split (2 * side length in total). Then whichever half of the grid as the maximum value that you know, you go there.

### solution in $3 \cdot n + 210$ queries
Notice that you dont need all the queries along a row. It suffices to pick a side length and find the max. Then query the 6 values next to it. The rest is the same as the above solution. This takes half as many queries as well as $6$ per layer. This is in total $3 \cdot n + 6 \cdot 2 \cdot \log n$ which is less than $3 \cdot n + 210$ queries.

the total time complexity is also $O(n^2 \log n)$ 

Solution code

```cpp

void go(int a, int b, int c, int d){
	if(a + 1 == b && c + 1 == d){
		assert(op <= n*3 +210);
		cout << "! " << a+1 << " " << c+1 << endl;
		return ;
	}
	int m1 = (a + b)/2, m2 = (c + d)/2;
	if(b - a > d - c){ //split the longer one
		int best = c;
		for(int i = c; i<d; i++){
			if(query(m1, i) > query(m1, best)){
				best = i;
			}
		}
		for(int i = -1; i<=1; i++){
			for(int j = -1; j<=1; j++){
				query(m1 + i, best + j);
			}
		}
		if(mxin(a, m1, c, d) > mxin(m1, b, c, d)){
			go(a, m1, c, d);
		}else{
			go(m1, b, c, d);
		}
	}else{
		int best = a;
		for(int i = a; i<b; i++){
			if(query(i, m2) >= query(best, m2)){
				best = i;
			}
		}
		for(int i = -1; i<=1; i++){
			for(int j = -1; j<=1; j++){
				query(best + i, m2 + j);
			}
		}	
		if(mxin(a, b, c, m2) > mxin(a, b, m2, d)){
			go(a, b, c, m2);
		}else{
			go(a, b, m2, d);
		}
	}
}
```
